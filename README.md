This repo is my note for the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/tree/main). I will follow the book to build a large language model from scratch.

The difference from the official repo is that in this repo I will add some of my own notes and some of my own implementation methods.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kyriekevin/LLMs-from-scratch.git
   ```

2. Setup the environment
   The detailed environment setup can be found in the [setup](./setup)
